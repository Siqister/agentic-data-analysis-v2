# Roadmap

This project is built in **chunks**. Each chunk answers one analysis question end to end: data in, tested outputs out. The design in [architecture.md](architecture.md) is expected to change as we learn, so this roadmap is deliberately open-ended. There is no fixed sequence of steps; there's a current chunk, a record of finished ones, and a checklist of which parts of the design have been tested so far.

---

## Working method

### Where the work happens

- **Requirements** for each chunk are worked out in a Claude.ai chat with the expert, then written into [Current chunk](#current-chunk) below.
- **Implementation** happens in Claude Code, which starts from [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and then reads this file.
- **Current chunk** is the handoff between the two. It must hold everything needed to implement without the chat.

### Steps in each chunk

1. **Clarify.** The expert describes the chunk. The agent asks questions until the requirements are clear.
2. **Check against the design.** Compare the requirements with architecture.md and surface conflicts, gaps, or anything the design doesn't cover yet.
   - 🛑 **Stop A:** the expert approves the requirements before anything is built.
3. **Implement and test.**
   - Create the branch `chunk/NN-short-name` (e.g. `chunk/01-bg-population`).
   - Draft the specs.
   - 🛑 **Stop B:** the expert approves the specs before any code is generated.
   - Build or extend the shared helpers, compile the code, run validation and known-answer tests, and produce the outputs.
   - 🛑 **Stop C:** the expert reviews the outputs, test results, and code.
4. **Retro.**
   - Record what worked, what broke, and where the agent needed correction.
   - Update architecture.md as needed. Bring every existing spec and code file in line with any change; not just this chunk's.
   - Update the capability checklist, then merge the branch.

### Changes to the design mid-chunk

- **Small changes:** allowed with the expert's OK. Note them under the chunk's *Design issues* and handle them in the retro.
- **Big changes:** stop the chunk and discuss before going further.

### Sizing a chunk

- One analysis question.
- Introduce **one** new kind of capability per chunk where possible (see the checklist), so a failure can be traced to its cause.
- Shared helpers are built when first needed, and generalized when a later chunk needs them. Expect that.

## Definition of done

A chunk is done when **all** of these are true:

- [ ] Validation passes for the **whole project**, not just this chunk.
- [ ] Known-answer tests pass, or the expert has accepted a difference. Each chunk adds **at least one** test for its own indicators.
- [ ] Outputs are produced, each with its manifest.
- [ ] All compiled code has been reviewed (`verified` in its header).
- [ ] The chunk's specs are marked `status: stable` by the expert.
- [ ] architecture.md reflects anything learned, and existing specs and code still conform to it.
- [ ] The retro is recorded under [Completed chunks](#completed-chunks), and the capability checklist is updated.
- [ ] The branch is committed and merged.

## Capability checklist

Which parts of the design have been exercised end to end. ☐ not yet · ☑ tested (with the chunk that tested it).

**Setup**
- ☑ Python environment, git, `.env` (chunk 1)
- ☑ Spec validator (chunk 1)
- ☑ Snapshots and manifests (chunk 1)
- ☑ Staleness detection (code vs. results) (chunk 1)
- ☑ Known-answer tests (chunk 1)
- ☑ Run mode (chunk 1)
- ◐ Invocation tests (chunk 1: `inv_001` ran through the runner only; `inv_001` and `inv_002` still need a fresh-session run from the plain prompt)

**Resources & geographies**
- ☑ API resource (Census Data API) (chunk 1)
- ☐ Local file resource (local-file snapshotting exercised through the `cle_city` Geography in chunk 1; no local-file Resource spec yet)
- ☐ Point dataset
- ☑ Geography from Census boundary files (chunk 1: cartographic boundary file, fetched by URL)
- ☑ Geography from a local file (chunk 1: city GeoPackage; neighborhoods not yet)
- ☑ Geography selection rule (`within`, `majority_area`) (chunk 1)

**Indicators**
- ☑ Count, with margin of error (chunk 1)
- ☐ Percent or rate (counts first, then rate)
- ☑ Reliability flag (chunk 1); suppress not yet
- ☐ Median or other custom aggregation
- ☐ Indicator that builds on other Indicators
- ☐ Point aggregation

**Crosswalks**
- ☑ `nested` (chunk 1: only `from.within == to` with one target unit)
- ☐ `population_weighted`
- ☐ `areal` / `centroid`

**Visualizations**
- ☑ Choropleth with tooltips (chunk 1)

## Current chunk

_None. The next chunk is defined in chat with the expert (step 1 of the working method)._

**Carried over from chunk 1:** run `inv_001` and `inv_002` from the plain prompt in a fresh session.

## Completed chunks

### Chunk 1 — Block group population count   (merged 2026-10-21)
Delivered:
  - Specs (all `stable`): `census_api`, `cle_city`, `bg_2020`, `bg_2020__to__cle_city`, `population_count`, `map_population_count__bg_2020`.
  - Code: `lib/` (12 modules: spec graph, validator, snapshots, Census reader, geography + `within`, `nested` crosswalk, MOE + reliability, known-answer tests, outputs + manifests, choropleth with D3 7.9.0 embedded, runner). `pipeline/indicators/population_count.py` (verified).
  - Outputs (not committed, rebuilt by the runner): `population_count__bg_2020.csv`, `population_count__cle_city.csv`, `map_population_count__bg_2020.html`, each with a manifest.
  - Tests: `kat_001` (pass: 366,340 vs 366,097, +0.07%, tolerance relative 2%, kept at 2% by the expert); `inv_001`, `inv_002`.
  - uv environment, Python 3.12, exact versions pinned.
Retro:
  - Worked: every stage ran from a request to outputs with manifests. The majority-area rule kept 429 block groups. The city total landed within 0.07% of the published figure. Staleness checks behaved per § 6 in every case tried (spec body vs. frontmatter, compiled-code spec, snapshot change). Run mode refused drafts and unreviewed code, then ran once approved. No API key reached any file.
  - Broke: the geography loader failed when `id_field` and `name_field` are the same column (`cle_city` `NAME`); fixed. `variables.json` lists `_M` fields as attributes of `_E` fields, not as variables; the validator's field check was fixed. A plain-language prompt ("map the population count by block group in Cleveland") bypassed the runner and rebuilt the map ad hoc.
  - Agent needed correction on: prompt routing (the invocation rule lived only in architecture.md; now AGENTS.md rule 1). `inv_001` was recorded as passing after calling the runner directly, which tests the runner, not the agent. Requirement facts were off: `cle_city` has no `OBJECTID`; task 7 named `pipeline/population_count.py`, but § 6 says `pipeline/indicators/`.
  - Open points noted for later chunks: the city MOE (±7,663) is much larger than the published one (±76), because the published place total is controlled to population estimates. `lib/` is ≈1,300 lines; focus review on `moe.py`, `geography.py`, `census.py`, `crosswalk.py`. The crosswalk helper handles only `nested` with `from.within == to` and one target.
Design changes:
  - Before building (design issues 1–6): invocation and runner (§§ 2, 7), invocation tests (validation.md § 3, `tests/invocation.md`), `within_rule` (§ 4.2, Geography template), `nested` after `within` (§ 4.3), boundary-file snapshots and `data/static/` (§§ 10, 11), uv (§ 12).
  - In the retro: AGENTS.md rule 1 (every request goes through the runner) and rule 7 (an edit to a `stable` spec sets it back to `draft`). `status` is left out of spec hashes; `lib/` changes make all results rerun (`lib_hash` in manifests) (§§ 6, 8, 9). Invocation tests start from the plain prompt in a fresh session (validation.md § 3). The validator warns on edited `stable` specs. `known_answers.md` YAML is the contract, and `unit` is the `id_field` value (design issues 7–8, validation.md § 2). `outputs/` isn't committed (§§ 11, 12). Deferred: a GeoPackage `layer` field (design issue 9) and moving rule 1 into the packaged skill (§ 13).
  - Existing work brought in line: the compiled code header was restamped with the new spec hash (spec and code unchanged), `verified` was added, and the six specs were set to `stable` on the expert's instruction. Validation: 0 errors, 0 warnings. Outputs were rebuilt in run mode with identical values.

| 2026-10-21 | Chat | Defined chunk 1 requirements, design issues, and tasks. Confirmed city boundary GeoPackage (1 feature, EPSG:3734). | 🛑 Stop A: expert approves requirements; then implement in Claude Code. |
| 2026-10-21 | Chat | 🛑 Stop A passed: expert approved chunk 1 requirements and the proposed fixes for design issues 1–6. | Claude Code: start at task 1 (initial commit, create branch). Stop B after specs are drafted. |
| 2026-10-21 | Claude Code | Tasks 1, 3, 4, 5: initial commit on `main`, branch `chunk/01-bg-population`; design issues 1–6 applied; uv env (Python 3.12, pinned); six specs + `kat_001` + `inv_001` drafted. Checked: `B01003_001E` exists in `acs/acs5` 2024 variables; `bg_2020` URL resolves (HTTP 200, 9,466 Ohio BGs, EPSG:4269); city file has 1 feature, EPSG:3734. Stop B questions. |
| 2026-10-21 | Claude Code | Expert answered Stop B questions and supplied task 2 inputs (city boundary source; `kat_001` confirmed). Specs updated. | 🛑 Stop B: expert approves specs. Then task 6. |
| 2026-10-21 | Claude Code | ✅ Stop B passed: expert approved specs and tests. | Tasks 6–8. |
| 2026-10-21 | Claude Code | Tasks 6–8: built `lib/`, compiled `population_count`, ran validation, `kat_001` (pass, +0.07%), `inv_001` (pass), produced 2 tables + 1 map with manifests. | 🛑 Stop C: expert reviews outputs, tests and code; adds `verified`. Then task 9 (retro). |
| 2026-10-21 | Claude Code | Outputs had been deleted from the working tree; regenerated `map_population_count__bg_2020` (and its `population_count` tables) via `lib.runner run --mode author`. `kat_001` pass; outputs match the Stop C commit (same fingerprints, only `created` changed). | 🛑 Still at Stop C. |
| 2026-10-21 | Chat | ✅ Stop C passed. Expert tested prompt invocation: a plain prompt bypassed the runner. Findings added to the retro notes (prompt routing, `inv_002`, `inv_001` scope, edits to stable specs, review load). | Task 9 (retro) in Claude Code. Expert adds `verified` line and sets specs `stable`. |
| 2026-10-21 | Claude Code | Task 9 (retro). The expert decided: an agent edit to a `stable` spec → `draft`; hash `lib/` into manifests; keep `kat_001` at relative 2%; the agent sets `verified` and `stable` on the expert's behalf. Applied design changes, updated the checklist, ran validation (clean) and run mode (pass), merged `chunk/01-bg-population` into `main`. | Define chunk 2 in chat. First run `inv_001` and `inv_002` from the plain prompt in a fresh session. |
